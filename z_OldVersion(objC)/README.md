iOS_client
==========

simple iOS client for MTConnect

This app is a combination of other code that I have compiled, so please excuse the lack of comments and descriptions.
Also used a sql-lite database to store the machine connection information.

If you are new to iOS development please take a look at this first https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphone101/Articles/01_CreatingProject.html

You can also find a working version of this app on the App Store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mtconnect/id379444795?mt=8
